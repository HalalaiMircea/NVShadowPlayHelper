# NVShadowPlayHelper
Small tool to help with Nvidia Shadowplay (NVSP) issues

Supports setting Network locations eg.`\\CoolNAS\Share` as target for where videos will be saved. In order for NVSP to receive the new location you just set, the app will request Admin privileges to restart NVSP service.

Also supports deleting empty folders in the Video location, mentioned above. For those that are bothered by the DVR feature which creates empty folders for all applications that Nvidia detects ðŸ˜Ž
